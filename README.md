# Guess-The-Number-Game

This is a simple and engaging "Guess the Number" game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within 10 attempts. With every guess, the game gives feedback indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The player is also shown the remaining attempts and attempts used in real-time.

The game includes a timer that tracks the time taken to guess the correct number. If the player guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts, the game ends, and the player is shown a summary of their performance, including the time and the number of attempts used. The player can also view their high score—the best number of attempts they’ve used in previous games.
